# Partify

A mobile web application to stream music together.

## Why use partify?

Let's say you're at a party and some one is streaming music from their spotify account.
If you want to add songs to the playlist you'll need to ask that guy and use their phone, or, you'll need to have
spotify premium yourself.

So with partify you wont need any of that!

You can create a room connected straight to your spotify and every one how joins your room can add songs!
